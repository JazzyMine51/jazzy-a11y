# Jazzy A11y

This is a website for me to advertize myself to employers, I want to show that i can design and make websites to look pretty and be accessible at the same time. 

This site will have the following tabs:
- Home page
    - Basic info about me and the site
- Articles / Blog
    - This is where I will blog about what I learn about a11y and other web dev things
    - each article will have tags to search on
        - this will use a library like Lunr.js or PageFind to search the articles
- A11y Tools
    - This is where I will have articles about a11y tools that i used in my career / learning
- About
    - Information about me, the person
    - My CV
- Contact
    - How to get into contact with me

This site will have the following A11Y features
- content block skip
- search bar
    - search for any page / content on the site
    - this feature will take the most time to develop
- proper alt text
- proper aria (when needed)
- (do my best to) comply with WCAG 2.2 AA


The end goal is that BootStrap CSS will be used but no JS / custom components will be used. This is just to show off, I want to get the site running before moving away from some components. Right now the only component is the Nav Bar / Burger Menu on mobile
